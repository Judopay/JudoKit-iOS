/**
 *   The JudoPayInputField is a UIView subclass that is used to help to validate and visualize common information related to payments. This class delivers the common ground for the UI and UX. Text fields can either be used in a side-by-side motion (title on the left and input text field on the right) or with a floating title that floats to the top as soon as a user starts entering their details.
 
 It is not recommended to use this class directly but rather use the subclasses of JudoPayInputField that are also provided in judoKit as this class does not do any validation which are necessary for making any kind of transaction.
